Edited and configured the database for users, which now should allow for users
to both register and sign up, and all other cases are dealt with. 
There should no longer be a way to go into another account, and users may not
register under another account or log in without the right password
Both pages log the user in, and the user is sent to a main page, where we can
add our stories
Question: Is there a better way to redirect and render template at the same time,
so that both are in the same place?
