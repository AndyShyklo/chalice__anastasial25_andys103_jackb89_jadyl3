## Description of website
Our project is a collaborative story-telling website. Upon registering, users can log into their account to create, edit, or view stories. However, when adding a chapter to a story, users are only shown the title and the latest update; they cannot view an entire story until they have edited it or forfeited their right to edit it. While viewing a story, users can also comment in the comments section or on any chapter within the story. Website admins can create, edit, view, comment on, and delete all stories. All logged-in users can see a list of the stories they have contributed to on their home page, and can log out at any time.
